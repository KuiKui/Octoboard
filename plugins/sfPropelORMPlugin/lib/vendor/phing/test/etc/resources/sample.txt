Texas Funeral broke up

After over 7 years together Texas Funeral (formerly Rapture) pulled the plug and unanimously broke up in peace.

Despite all the little ups and downs we had during the past seven years it was always a joy and ultimate thrill for us playing and writing music together. Given the fact that nobody in the band could play an instrument when we first started in late 1997, we are very proud of what we achieved all those years of making music. But eventually every band runs its course and the time comes to break up before the music gets compromised. As positive thinking beings we realize that with each crisis there's another chance. All of us are going to continue with making and playing music giving it a fresh start in different bands or projects. So watch out.

We thank all our loved ones, fans, friends, and people involved in, or somehow related to the band for their everlasting awesome support and love during the years. We hope we brought you some fun and pleasure listening to our music and having a good time at our concerts.

Love, Peace, and Rock'n'Roll
