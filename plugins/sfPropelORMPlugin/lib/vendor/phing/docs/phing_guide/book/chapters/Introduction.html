<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2><a name="WhatPhingIs"></a>What Phing Is</h2>

<p> Phing is a project build system based on Apache ant <a href="Bibliography.html#ant">[ant]</a>.
  You can do anything with Phing that you could do with a traditional build system
  like Gnu make <a href="Bibliography.html#gnumake">[gnumake]</a>, and Phing's
  use of simple XML build files and extensible PHP &quot;task&quot; classes make
  it an easy-to-use and highly flexible build framework.</p>
<p>Because Phing is based on Ant, parts of this manual are also adapted from the
  ant manual (see <a href="Bibliography.html#ant">[ant]</a>). We are extremely
  grateful to the folks in the Ant project for creating (and continuing to create)
  such an inspiring build system model, and for the open-source licensing that
  makes it possible for us to learn from each other and build increasingly better
  tools. </p>
<h2><a name="PhingAndBinarycloud"></a>Phing &amp; Binarycloud:
  History</h2>

<p> Phing was originally a subproject of Binarycloud. Binarycloud is a highly
  engineered application framework, designed for use in enterprise environments.
  Binarycloud uses XML extensively for storing metadata about a project (configuration,
  nodes, widgets, site structure, etc.). Because Binarycloud is built for PHP,
  performing extensive XML processing and transformations on each page request
  is an unrealistic proposition. Phing is used to &quot;compile&quot; the XML
  metadata into PHP arrays that can be processed without overhead by PHP scripts.
</p>
<p>Of course, XML &quot;compilation&quot; is only one of many ways that Binarycloud
  uses the Phing build system. The Phing build system makes it possible for you
  to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Build multi language pages from one source tree (see binarycloud documentation
    and [below in this document]), </li>
  <li>Centralize metadata (e.g. your data model) in one XML file and generate
    several files from that XML with different XSLT.</li>
</ul>

<p> It the beginning, Binarycloud used the GNU make system; however, this approach
  had some drawbacks: The &quot;space-before-tab&quot;-problem in makefiles, the
  fact that it is only natively available for Unix systems etc. So, the need for
  a better build system arose. Apache Ant was a logical choice -- do to its use
  of XML build files and modular design. The problem was that Ant is written in
  Java, so you need to install a JVM on your computer to use it. Besides the need
  for yet another interpreter (i.e. besides PHP), there was also legal/ideological
  conflict in requiring a commercial JVM (there were problems with Ant on JVMs
  other than Sun's) for an LGPL'd Binarycloud.</p>

<p>So, the development of Phing began. Phing is a build system written in PHP
  and uses the ideas of Ant. The first release was designed &amp; developed simultaneously,
  and thus not very sophisticated. This original system was quickly pushed to
  its limits and the need for a better Phing became a priority. Andreas Anderhold,
  who was responsible for Phing/r1, designed and wrote much of the Phing/r2 that
  followed. Phing/r2 became the Phing-1.0 that exists today for PHP4.</p>

<p>The current development of Phing is focused on Phing 2, which has involved
  a number of bugfixes, functionality enhancements, and most significantly a conversion
  of the codebase to use new PHP5 features such as abstract classes, interfaces,
  and try/catch/throw exception handling.</p>

<h2><a name="HowPhingWorks"></a>How Phing Works</h2>
<p>Phing uses XML <em>buildfiles</em> that contain a description of the things to do. The buildfile
is structured into targets that contain the actual commands to perform (e.g. commands to copy a file,
delete a directory, perform a DB query, etc.).  So, to use Phing, you would first write your buildfile
and then you would run phing, specifying the target in your buildfile that you want to execute.</p>
<pre title="simple phing example">% phing -f mybuildfile.xml mytarget</pre>
<p>By default Phing will look for a buildfile named <em>build.xml</em> (so you don't have to specify the
buildfile name unless it is not <em>build.xml</em>) and if no target is specified Phing
will try to execute the default target, as specified in the &lt;project&gt; tag.</p>

<h2><a name="HowCanIHelp"></a>Cool, so how can I help?</h2>

<p>Phing is under active development and there are many things to be done. To
  get involved, you can start by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Read this manual to understand Phing ;-)</li>
  <li>Go to http://phing.tigris.org and subscribe to the &quot;dev&quot; mailing list</li>
</ul>
