/**
 * ValidatorMap is used to model a column validator.
 *
 * GENERAL NOTE
 * ------------
 * The propel.map classes are abstract building-block classes for modeling
 * the database at runtime.  These classes are similar (a lite version) to the
 * propel.engine.database.model classes, which are build-time modeling classes.
 * These classes in themselves do not do any database metadata lookups.
